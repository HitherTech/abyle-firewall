Abyle Firewall Script (abyle-firewall)

the abyle iptables script is one of a million iptables scripts arround the
internet, it was developed for fun and learning some python basics.

the configurion and rules are stored in xml files within an hierarchically
per interface directory structure.

most people will say "what .. for?"
especially if they look at the not very straight xml syntax of the rules
file, we have to answer: "just for fun" that's our purpose. :)
